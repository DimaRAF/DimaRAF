# About Me

Welcome to my personal repository — a living archive of my journey as a **Software Engineering** passionate about turning innovative ideas into real solutions.

##  About Me
Software Engineer with First-Class Honors (GPA 4.99/5), passionate about building intelligent, scalable, and real-world systems that combine solid software engineering with applied machine learning.

I have strong hands-on experience in mobile application development and AI-driven systems, with a particular focus on digital health, data-centric solutions, and workflow automation.

My technical background includes applied research and development using:
	•	Deep learning models for time-series forecasting and classification (GRU, MPL/MLP architectures)
	•	Medical and real-world datasets (feature engineering, data cleaning, labeling, and evaluation)
	•	TensorFlow / TensorFlow Lite for training and on-device deployment
	•	Computer vision pipelines including ROI detection using modern detection frameworks
	•	Secure data and image processing pipelines, including encryption-aware workflows
	•	Model evaluation and experimentation using Python and scientific tooling

My core engineering strengths include:
	•	Mobile application development using Flutter
	•	Building and integrating AI-powered features (prediction, classification, and decision support)
	•	Backend and system integration through RESTful APIs
	•	Workflow automation using Google Apps Script and cloud-based workflows
	•	UI/UX design and prototyping using Figma

In parallel, I am actively developing my skills in MLOps and production-ready AI systems, including:
	•	Experiment tracking and model versioning
	•	Model packaging and lightweight deployment for mobile and edge environments
	•	CI/CD concepts for ML pipelines
	•	Cloud-based model deployment and monitoring workflows

I bring a strong combination of research-driven machine learning, practical software engineering, and product-oriented thinking, enabling me to deliver AI solutions that are reliable, secure, and ready for real-world use
